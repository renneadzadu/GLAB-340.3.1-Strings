# GLAB-340.4.1-Strings

## Introduction
In this project, learner will create a word play game using Python strings. The game will prompt the user to enter a word, and then apply a series of operations to the word to generate new words.

## Lab Overview
In this lab, we'll demonstrate how to use python to interact with Strings. Learner should be able to interact with string and return result by the end of this lab.

## Examples

### Word Play

***Functionality*** 

- [ ] The game will ask the user to enter a word.
- [ ] The program will print the length of the word.
- [ ] The program will print the word in uppercase and lowercase.
- [ ] The program will ask the user to enter a letter and count how many times that letter appears in the word.
- [ ] The program will ask the user to enter a substring and count how many times that substring appears in the word.
- [ ] The program will reverse the word and print the result.
- [ ] The program will ask the user to enter a starting and ending index, and then slice the word and print the result.
- [ ] The program will ask the user to enter a character and replace the first occurrence of that character with another character.
- [ ] The program will concatenate the original word with a second word entered by the user.
- [ ] The program will check if the original word is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forward and backward).
- [ ] The program will check if the original word is a valid Python identifier (i.e., it starts with a letter or underscore, and only contains letters, digits, and underscores).

***Example Output***

```
Enter a word: python
Length of word: 6
Uppercase: PYTHON
Lowercase: python
Enter a letter: t
't' appears 1 time(s) in 'python'
Enter a substring: th
'sth' appears 0 time(s) in 'python'
Reverse: nohtyp
Enter a starting index: 2
Enter an ending index: 5
Sliced word: tho
Enter a character to replace: p
Enter the replacement character: x
Replaced: xython
Enter a second word: rocks
Concatenated: pythonrocks
Is a palindrome? No
Is a valid Python identifier? Yes

```
